Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container 
is not enough. In these cases, we can apply the order property to 
individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this 
property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).

Use the order property to reorder elements 

example:

#pond{
    display: flex;
}

.yellow{
    order: 1;
}
-2 moves it 2 over to the left, 
-1 moves it 1 over to the left, 
0 does not move it unless there are elements with stronger or weaker values, 
1 moves it 1 over to the right
2 moves it 2 over to the righht
