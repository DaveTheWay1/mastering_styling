FLEX-WRAP

flex-wrap property, which accepts the following values:

nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse

example:

#div {
  display: flex;
flex-wrap:wrap;
flex-direction:column;
}

for better understanding, this property works best when we want things to fit on screen, 
including when the width of the screen decrease, but instead of cutting out the screen it
allows the element to wrap around itself.

********* a normal size width

******shorter width cause a cut off for the element

******
***   shorter width, the element wrapped around instead of cutting off 

***
******  shorter width, the element wrapped around instead of cutting off
        but instead of going below, as it goes reverse, it goes upward 
        and from right to left
