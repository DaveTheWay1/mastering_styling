ALIGN SELF works just like ALIGN ITEMS except it is used on individual items.

there can be multiple of that item. for example: lets say in a group of colors we
have different colors and yellow. we give the yellow a class and we are able to used that
align-self on that yellow.

align-self is used to help align items vertically and accepts the following values:
    flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
    flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
    center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
    baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
    stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

example

#color_div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.yellow {
align-self: flex-end;
}
