ALIGN ITEMS (VERTICAL)

use align-items to help alig items vertically and accepts the following values:
    flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
    flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
    center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
    baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
    stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

example:
#id {
  display: flex;
align-items: flex-end;
}

Yes, for the align-items property to work as expected, you need to have 
a container with display: flex (or display: inline-flex) or display: grid. 
This is because align-items is part of the Flexbox and Grid Layout modules 
in CSS, and it controls how items are aligned along the cross-axis 
(perpendicular to the main axis).
